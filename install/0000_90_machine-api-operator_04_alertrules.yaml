              If the machine never became a node, you should diagnose the machine related failures.
              If the node was deleted from the API, you may delete the machine if appropriate.

              The machine has been without a Running or Deleting phase for more than 60 minutes.
              The machine may not have been provisioned properly from the infrastructure provider, or
              it might have issues with CertificateSigningRequests being approved.

            description: |
              The machine is not properly deleting, this may be due to a configuration issue with the
              infrastructure provider, or because workloads on the node have PodDisruptionBudgets or
              long termination periods which are preventing deletion.

              The number of unhealthy machines has exceeded the `maxUnhealthy` limit for the check, you should check
              the status of machines in the cluster.
